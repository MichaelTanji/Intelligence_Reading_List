Whether you're new to the field or your introduction to it glossed over it, your knowledge of the space cannot help but be better informed and your practice more well rounded, by reading what is arguably the best history of intelligence.

Olson, James

You've seen movies: spying is sexy stuff. Actually, it can be, but like any risky proposition, the work come with a lot of mental, emotional, and ethical baggage. Get a better and balanced understanding of what its like to actually do the work when the rules are not clear-cut and the problems grave.

Mitrokhin, Vasili

The holy grail of intelligence collection is the work of the adversary in their own words. What they think and say when they're absolutely, positively sure the other side will never know what is being discussed...until a trusted insider makes off with all of that information.

Jones, Morgan

If you can only get one book to teach you how to think like an analyst and perform core analytic functions, it should be this one. It isn't an "intelligence" book *per se* but the techniques would be familiar to anyone who has received formal intelligence training.

***[Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1452241511/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1452241511&linkId=56d2292f96b538408d945de313913398)***
Heuer, Richards; Pherson, Randolph

A great resource for those who are starting out, and those who need a refresher. Every analyst in the IC goes through a 'boot camp' of sorts to acquire the same skills you'll pick up in the text. More accessible than works like Clark's, which are really for those with some seasoning under their belts. More specific than Morgan, which can be applied to just about any problem, not just intelligence ones.

***[Intelligence Analysis: A Target Centric Approach](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/154436914X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=154436914X&linkId=327492438b72b861c36c4595fca8c0f6)***

The go-to text on the practices most associate with "intelligence" work; trying to determine what's going to happen in the future. A solid grounding in the techniques used to develop well-reasoned and justifiable forecasts.

Stephenson, William

Bond, James Bond is a stylized (often times laughable) version of what life is like on the front lines of human intelligence. It is important to remember that success in the field has little to do with your gender and everything to do with your wits, will, and intestinal fortitude.

***[A Man Called Intrepid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V9QVE5O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00V9QVE5O&linkId=7f90873fad99840160b867783a624962)***
Stevenson, William

The U.S. didn't rush headlong into WWII, it needed a push (a couple of them). Stevenson was one of those with the biggest hands and the greatest force.

Hoffman, David

Deciding to become an agent of a foreign power does not come easy. All too often there is a price to be paid, and in this case it was the ultimate price. The value of that effort, that initial decision is technically calculable but in the scheme of things, a priceless sacrifice we cannot hope to repay.

Budiansky, Stephen

For those new to the field, a great and accessible history of the birth, growth, and successes of the world's premier SIGINT organization. Far from a hagiography, it provides a balanced view of the problems that inevitably arise in a hide-bound institution facing radical change, and the mistakes that were made along the way.

Mundy, Liza

Today in technology the problem (*a* problem) is how to get more women into the field. Back in the day a great deal of technological work carried out in the name of national security was done almost exclusively - or perhaps more accurately most extensively - by women. The practical definition of a *computer* or one who computes was a "code girl" or her equivalent in other disciplines. Women in STEM? Meet their OGs.

Kahn, David

Less an emphasis on NSA and its counterparts around the world, and much more a history of cryptography and the role it has played in political/military events throughout the ages. 

***[The Puzzle Palace](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140067485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0140067485&linkId=9bcfcebc87959e7b61832250d5da01c2)***
Bamford, James

The NSA, decades out of the Washington DC 'closet', is still described as "super secret." This is the book, written by one of its (former) own, that first lifted that veil of secrecy. A grundbreaking and somewhat scandelous work when it came out, it remains one of the best sources about the organizations and its inner workings during the peak of the cold war and, arguably, its power until the "age of information" began.

Barron, John

Betrayal is a tough pill to swallow, but if looked at objectively the most instructive way to learn about the opposition and what is and isn't working for your own service. It helps that in this case things worked to our favor, because if it had turned out the other way around it would have been devastating.

***[Molehunt: The Secret Search for Traitors that Shattered the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394585143/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0394585143&linkId=709013482a0249829a7f64b24f55bab7)***
Wise, David

Counterintelligence has been defined as a "wilderness of mirrors," and in no case was this better illustrated than the wilds into which the CIA's CI chief was led. A rigorous CI effort is invaluable, but carelessness and a lack of focus can turn it into a devastaing witch hunt.

Rarely are real-life intelligence operations as glamorous and exciting as what is found in fiction. Cassidy's Run demonstrates that that's not always the case, and that sometimes fiction would be hard pressed to beat the real thing.

***[Capturing Johnathan Pollard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EGWFKBM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hafofthespe-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00EGWFKBM&linkId=d21e0c5a7e4f1cb499e81116ca8f87da)***
Olive, Ronald

The damage Pollard did to the country was significant, this despite the fact that his antics were so obvious and amateur. But human nature, and the foibles of our CI apparatus at the time, were arguably just as injurious to national security. Had we been paying attention, had people stuck to protocol, and if everyone had stopped being so parochial, the tent could have been pulled down over this circus.

The best spies are those who become spies because of ideology, and you would be hard pressed to find a better example than Ana Montes.

Wolf, Markus, McElvoy, Anne

Cold War espionage does not want for epic tales and outsized personalities, but you would be hard pressed to name someone who fit the bill so many ways as the head of the former East German *Stasi* intelligence service. As illustrative as the action associated with such a skilled (and feared) service, so too are the lessons learned in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and how people react when their *raison d'etre* not only no longer exists, but is now considered a damnable offense.

James Jesus Angleton was the head of CI at the CIA for 20 years. His successes up until and into the early days of that portion of his career were why he was able to accomplish what he did; and why he was allowed to do the damage he did. What happens when the job of navigating the wilderness of mirros becomes one of trying (and failing) to find your way out?
